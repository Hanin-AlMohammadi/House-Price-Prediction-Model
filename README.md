# House-Price-Prediction-Model
This project involves predicting house prices using a Linear Regression model. The dataset used contains various features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, and more. The project includes data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Additionally, a function is provided to predict the price of a house given its specific features.

This project demonstrates fundamental data preprocessing techniques, the use of Linear Regression for prediction, and evaluation of model performance.

Features:

. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
. Feature Selection
. Model Training using Linear Regression
. Model Evaluation using MAE, MSE, and R-squared
. Custom House Price Prediction Function
This project is a useful example of how to approach predictive modeling in real estate, focusing on house prices as the target variable.
